# Credit-scoring-with-machine-learning-
Creating machine learning model to predict a credit default



In this project i created machine learning models using different classifier then from comparative analysis between them i can choose the best one based on their performances to make predictions of costumer status.
At the end of the project i built a dashboard where i can enter costumer information and by one click i get prediction and decision made by the model you have chosen.
